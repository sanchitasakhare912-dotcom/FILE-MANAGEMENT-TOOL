*DISCRIPTION*: In this project, I created a basic tool using C++ that lets you work with text files—kind of like a mini notepad app, but in the terminal. The program gives you a menu with options to write new content to a file, add more content to an existing file, and read what’s already inside a file. It’s a great way to learn how file handling works in C++.

I used standard C++ features like ofstream and ifstream to open and manage files. When you choose to write, the program asks you to type your content and saves it to the file. If you choose to append, it adds your new content to the end of the file without deleting what was already there. And if you choose to read, it shows you everything that’s inside the file line by line.

To keep things organized, I put all the file-handling logic inside a class called FileManager. That way, each task—writing, appending, and reading—has its own function, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.

I ran and tested the program using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is a code editor that makes it easy to write, compile, and run C++ programs. It has a built-in terminal, so I could see the output right away and make changes quickly.

Overall, this project helped me understand how C++ interacts with files and how to build a simple user interface in the terminal. It’s a solid starting point for more advanced tools, like file search, deletion, or even working with binary files.
